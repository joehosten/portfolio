  "description": "This is a project for a University Lab Session. The lab comprises of basic HTML practices made for the first semester of my second year. Having experience in HTML and CSS already made this a simple task for me. Aside from simple HTML and CSS, RizzTable utilises a backend written in JS and uses SQL as the data storage. I decided to make something funny which helped my motivation in creating this.. project. ",
